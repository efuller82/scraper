# Daily Sentinel Scraper
This application uses cheerio to scrape data from my small hometown newspaper website  
www.dailysentinel.com and using Jquery, puts that data into a Mongo db and presents  
that data onto the page.  

## What went wrong?  
I ran out of time, for one.  I need more training on getting routes and the db to interact.  
I finally got the Mongodb to read the schema using Mongoose, but alas, it was the  
last day.

## What else went wrong?
Since I couldn't get the application to work on my local machine, I didn't attempt to  
fix the other problem of getting it deployed to Heroku.

## Will I finish this?
Yes.  Before I apply for any job, this application will be finished because the technologies  
learned are important to full stack web development.
